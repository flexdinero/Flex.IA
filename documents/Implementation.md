## Current Status

### Development Environment
- **Status**: Fully operational
- **Database**: SQLite with sample data
- **Server**: Running on localhost:3000
- **Build**: Successful with no critical errors
- **Tests**: Basic structure in place, needs expansion

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, minimal any types
- **Linting**: ESLint configured with Next.js rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier setup for consistent code style
- **Testing**: Jest and Cypress configured, tests needed

### Performance Metrics
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Next.js automatic splitting
- **Loading Speed**: Fast development server with HMR
- **Accessibility**: Basic ARIA support, needs comprehensive audit
- **SEO**: Meta tags configured, needs content optimization

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Authentication**: Demo two-factor implementation needs production-ready TOTP
2. **Error Handling**: Needs comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
3. **Loading States**: Missing loading indicators for async operations
4. **Form Validation**: Basic validation in place, needs enhanced UX
5. **API Error Handling**: Needs standardized error response format

### Performance Issues
1. **Image Optimization**: Placeholder images need proper optimization
2. **Bundle Analysis**: No current bundle size monitoring
3. **Caching Strategy**: No caching implementation for API responses
4. **Database Queries**: No query optimization or indexing strategy

### Security Concerns
1. **Rate Limiting**: No API rate limiting implementation
2. **Input Sanitization**: Basic validation, needs XSS protection
3. **CORS Configuration**: Default settings, needs production hardening
4. **Environment Variables**: Some secrets in demo mode

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Choices
1. **State Management**: Currently using React Context, considering Zustand for complex state
2. **Real-time Features**: Evaluating WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events for live updates
3. **File Storage**: Planning integration with cloud storage (AWS S3 or Vercel Blob)
4. **Email Service**: Considering Resend or SendGrid for transactional emails

### Architecture Decisions
1. **API Design**: RESTful vs GraphQL for complex data relationships
2. **Database Migration**: Planning PostgreSQL migration for production
3. **Caching Strategy**: Redis consideration for session and data caching
4. **CDN Integration**: Vercel Edge Network vs external CDN

### UX/UI Considerations
1. **Mobile Experience**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance implementation
3. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support planning
4. **Offline Functionality**: Service worker for offline claim viewing
